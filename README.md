# views-sql

SQL plugin for the [views][1] library. Allows for plain SQL strings to 
be used.

Implementation is largely based on the views-honeysql library. As such,
the hints generated by either of these libraries are compatible with
each other. So you can opt to include honeysql and sql views in the
same view system if you wish and vexec! calls will trigger updates as
you would expect across all of these views.

Note that this library leverages [JSqlParser][2] for parsing SQL
queries and extracting the view system hint information needed.
JSqlParser is not perfect and will not be able to parse some more
complex queries and/or queries using some vendor-specific extensions.
